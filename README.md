## [Click Here to Check out the QUIZ APP.](https://emadnazzal.github.io/JS_ELEGENT_QUIZ_SAMPLE/) :grey_exclamation: :grey_exclamation:

### This is an elegent-classic design of a quiz app using vanilla JS, CSS and HTML.

### We used a straight .js file extension to get the data from instead of a of JSON.parse(file.js). we will implement this in the coming versions. :blush: :blush:

### The App has Timer features, a Moving time line feature, a dynamic friendly design, and many other.

### This is a good practice for beginner level JS projects :+1:

# In The Second Version We will try to make it different :

- Add different catagories, such as: sports, cultural, geography ..etc
- Mix the quiz possibilities using radar and checkbox using HTML
- create more advanced animated effects
- save results to a specific dashboard using localStorage :fire:
- USING A JSON FORMAT AND PARSE/STRINGFY FILES ACCORDINGLY
